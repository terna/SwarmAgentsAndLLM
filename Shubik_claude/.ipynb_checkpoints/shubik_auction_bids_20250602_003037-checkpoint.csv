2,Bob_Aggressive,30.0,15.0,0.0,"As a high-risk taker and aggressive bidder, I'm not afraid to push the stakes early on.

3,Eve_Gambler,50.0,30.0,15.0,"As a high-risk, high-reward gambler, I'm not afraid to raise the stakes early on.

6,Eve_Gambler,125.0,100.0,75.0,"As a gambler with a high-risk high-reward mentality, I'm willing to bid above the value of the prize. The thrill of the game and the potential of winning are more important to me than the actual value of the prize. I'm also trying to intimidate the other bidders by showing that I'm not afraid to overbid."
7,Bob_Aggressive,150.0,125.0,100.0,"As a high-risk taker and aggressive bidder, I'm not afraid to push the stakes even higher. While the bid is already above the value of the prize, my aggressive nature pushes me to outbid others and aim for the win, even if it means potentially losing money."

9,Eve_Gambler,200.0,175.0,150.0,"I love the thrill of gambling and pushing the limits.

Additionally, with my high budget limit and risk tolerance, I can afford to make this aggressive bid."
10,Eve_Gambler,225.0,200.0,175.0,"As a high-risk, high-reward gambler, I am not afraid of overbidding.

11,Iris_Competitive,230.0,225.0,200.0,"As an extremely competitive individual, I hate losing more than I love winning.

My budget limit also allows for this increase, so I'm willing to take the risk to potentially win."
