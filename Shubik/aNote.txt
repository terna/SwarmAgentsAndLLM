Prepare a code using ApenAI Agents with two agents playing Shubik's The Dollar Auction game: a paradox in
noncooperative behavior and escalation.
The auctioneer auctions off a dollar bill to the highest bidder, with the understanding that both the highest bidder and the second highest bidder will pay
Consider that I have OpenAI version 1.77.0. Prepare the code for running in Jupyter and create an easy way to choose the two characters.
I'd prefer to use the code in Jupyter





python3 -m json.tool dollar_auction.ipynb
 and then opening it in Jupyter. Let me know if you’d like me to drop you a
    quick patch to do exactly that.


   I’ve added the missing closing quotes and commas on the “Rational”,
    “Escalator”, and “Conservative” lines in the notebook’s JSON. Now python3 -m
     json.tool dollar_auction.ipynb succeeds, indicating the JSON is valid
    again. Let me know if you’d like anything else!
	
	

        2. From the directory containing `dollar_auction.ipynb`, launch the
    notebook server:

               jupyter notebook

           or, to use JupyterLab:

               jupyter lab
        3. A browser window will pop up (or open at http://localhost:8888).
    Simply click on `dollar_auction.ipynb` in the file list to open it.
        4. You can now run cells, edit code, and interact with your
    dollar‐auction simulation just like any other notebook.
	
	
I use OpenAI version 1.77.0
Executing dollar_auction.ipynb I get:

You tried to access openai.ChatCompletion, but this is no longer supported in openai>=1.0.0 - see the README at https://github.com/openai/openai-python for the API.

You can run `openai migrate` to automatically upgrade your codebase to use the 1.0.0 interface. 

Alternatively, you can pin your installation to the old version, e.g. `pip install openai==0.28`

A detailed migration guide is available here: https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742
